The goal is to find a way to use AI agents to build bigger systems. 

I have been experimenting on my bigger projects, but ChatGPT doesn't scale. 

So we need another way to modularize our applications and tests.

This project is not intended to be used by other people, it is mostly my experiment with Claude, ChatGPT and DeepSeek in combination with fsharp, xunit, property-based testing, and advanced algorithms.
